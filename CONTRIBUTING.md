## How to submit a PullRequest to Forge GitHub

### Quick note about branch names and the versioning convention used:
* When creating a new branch, prefix the branch name with "feature/".
* Ex) git branch feature/ForgeActionAttribute
* A new Forge DevOps build is kicked off each time either the master branch or a "feature/" branch gets pushed to GitHub.
* GitVersion is used to handle the versioning. It's set up for the standard SemVer, Major.Minor.Patch-<tags>.
* feature/ branches have the <alpha> tag appended to ensure they cannot be pushed as official Nuget updates.
* master branch updates do not have tags appended.

### Git commands
(Use cmd window for all commands)

```cmd
echo Set up new git workspace…
mkdir works-forge
cd works-forge
git init

echo You may be prompted for GitHub sign-in info…
git remote add origin https://github.com/microsoft/Forge.git
Git pull
git checkout master

echo Make changes on new branch and push…
git branch feature/<branch name>
git checkout feature/<branch name>
git commit -a -m "Adding new feature X."
git push --set-upstream origin feature/<branch name>
```

### Creating a PullRequest
After pushing your "feature/" branch upstream, you can view and create a PullRequest on the GitHub page for your branch.
